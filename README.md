# CKME 136 - Capstone Project
**Unsupervised learning** is a machine learning technique in which data is not labeled, classified or categorized before-hand. Data is grouped into clusters and learning is derived from the similarities of cluster members or dissimilarities among clusters.
Clustering can also be applied to geo-location data to compare various aspects of clusters formed in this manner.
I use Yelp Data Set to form geo-location based clusters of restaurant data to predict shortage or saturatuion of particular cateogries of businesses in various geographic areas in this project.
It is accomplished by clustering businesses by location, then comparison of clusters to check whether or not a particular cluster has shortage or saturation of particular type of food restaurants from the predicted demand of users who visit those clustered businesses.
